# Text to Emoji encryption😂😍😅😁😉😎

- My project is a text-to-emoji encryption and decryption application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The user interface consists of input fields for the text message and password, along with buttons for encryption and decryption. The encryption process involves converting each character of the input text into a corresponding emoji using its Unicode code point, and the resulting emoji sequence is displayed to the user.  The encrypted message and associated password are then stored in the browser's local storage for future retrieval.
- On the decryption side, users input the emoji sequence along with the password, and the application retrieves the corresponding original text from local storage, decrypts it, and displays the result.
- The project also incorporates a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. 
- Overall, the application provides a playful and interactive way to encode and decode messages using emojis, offering both practical use and entertainment.
